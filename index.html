	<p>
		Hello and welcome. It’s an honor to share my love of yoga with you. I’m Kimberly,
		a Certified Iyengar Yoga Teacher, and <em style="color:#a61969">“KZaM”</em> is a whimsical nickname that’s short for
		my real name: <em><span style="color:#a61969">K</span>imberly <span style="color:#a61969"> Za</span>nger <span style="color:#a61969"> M</span>ackesy.</em></h3>
	</p>

	<p>
		I go by <em style="color:#a61969">“KZaM”</em> because I believe in magic. Not magic where you wave a wand and 
		boom! your wish is granted, but the real kind of everyday magic that involves effort,
		letting go, and a hearty dash of mystery. A child’s first steps. An ace performance, 
		delivered. Balancing in a headstand for the first time. Life’s magical moments are
		created over time and realized in an instant; to me, creating these moments is what
		Yoga is all about.
	</p>

	<p>
		I invite you to explore this site, get in touch, and find out more about how you can 
		bring real yoga magic into your life.
	</p>
	<p>
		With love,
		Kimberly Zanger Mackesy, CIYT
	</p>
