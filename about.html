<h2>About Kim</h2>

<p>
	<img src="/images/kim.jpg" class="align"/>
	Kimberly Zanger Mackesy has taught yoga throughout California
	and overseas for the past 15 years. Her mission is <strong>to inspire and
	empower individuals to work toward profound physical, 
	mental and emotional transformations.</strong> This mission is rooted
	in gratitude for her own life, which she nearly lost as a young teen;
	profound fascination with the subject of yoga; and her calling to serve
	as a force for love in the world.
</p>
<p>
	Kimberly discovered yoga at age 19, following seven years of 
	gymnastics training in childhood and the life-changing injury that 
	ended it.</p>

<p>
	Growing up in rural Northern California, where property owners 
	often keep firearms, Kimberly had the misfortune to visit a home in 
	which rifles were stored in the closet rather than under lock and key. 
	An 8-year-old’s impulsive curiosity, an instant in the wrong place at 
	the wrong time…as improbable as it may be, Kimberly was shot by a 
	hunting rifle in May of 1989 when she was just 13 years old.
</p>

<p>
	The rest of her teens were spent healing the physical and 
	psychological wounds of the accident. Her physical body healed 
	within months; the mental and emotional healing took years. As a 
	young woman, Kimberly grappled chronic depression and anxiety, 
	symptoms of PTSD, persistent back pain, sciatica, and low self-
	esteem rooted in body image anxiety. 
</p>

<p>
	In college, her search for answers and relief led her to enroll in her 
	first yoga course in 1997. In that weekly gentle Hatha Yoga class, 
	Kimberly found yoga to be an incredibly powerful tool for relaxation, 
	stress relief, and pain management. She took up the practice and 
	enrolled in her first teacher training program at the <a href="http://www.yogaworks.com/en/locations/california%20south/los%20angeles/larchmont/" target="_blank"><em>Center for Yoga</em></a> 
	(now Yoga Works) while still an undergraduate at UCLA. It was 
	during this program that she discovered Iyengar Yoga. By 1999 it was 
	clear that she had found her path, and she’s practiced, studied and 
	taught exclusively in the Iyengar tradition ever since. (Why? See Why 
	Iyengar. Kimberly 
	had the honor of achieving Iyengar Yoga Certification in 2012.
</p>

<p>
	Nowadays, Kimberly studies regularly with Iyengar Yoga senior
	teachers as well as at the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute
	in Pune, India. At the RIMYI she has attended Medical Classes to 
	learn how to work with her injury, General Classes, Ladies’ Classes 
	and Pranayama. Having called several major cities “home,” Kimberly 
	has also studied extensively with five Iyengar Yoga senior teachers:

	Manouso Manos at <a href="http://manouso.com/" target="_blank"><em>the Abode of Iyengar Yoga</em></a> in San Francisco. 
	Kimberly attended the Iyengar Yoga teacher training program in San 
	Diego, a three-year, 500+ hour program was formulated with direct 
	guidance and continuous input from B.K.S. Iyengar.

	In addition to teaching yoga, Kimberly’s professional background 
	includes extensive work in education and the nonprofit sector. She 
	has taught academic writing, SAT preparation, substitute K-12, 
	and English as a Second Language. As a successful grant proposal 
	writer, Kimberly has raised more than $5 million for nonprofit 
	organizations. In 2008 she founded Prismatic Pen [link needed – 
	coming soon!], a writing and editing consultancy serving nonprofit
	organizations and small businesses. Kimberly’s desire to utilize all 
	of her skills for the greater good still leads her to take on select grant 
	writing and communications projects.

	When she’s not writing or practicing-teaching-studying yoga, 
	Kimberly loves to cook, read, enjoy the ocean, hike and travel.
